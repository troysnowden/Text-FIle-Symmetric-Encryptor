# Text-FIle-Symmetric-Encryptor
This is a simple program built using Python and Tkinter Frameworks that allows users to select multiple text files and encrypt them 
using a key (which is stored). You can then use this key to decrypt encrypted files.

This project aided in my development of my knowledge of symmetric encryption, and I feel proved beneficial to me.
